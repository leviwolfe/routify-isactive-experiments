### Get started

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to demonstrate proplem with `$isActive()` in [PeopleListItem.svelte](src/pages/_components/PeopleListItem.svelte). **This problem was fixed in routify 2.18.1** after a [Discord discussion](https://discord.com/channels/683709869626490889/684322968318509070/839583898143948811). This repo is using an old version of routify since it originally demonstrated the bug.
